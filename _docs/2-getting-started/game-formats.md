Over the years new versions of Twilight Imperium 4 have been released, both official and unofficial. 

The Async format has incorporated a fair few versions. With the Discord bot, you can play:
* Standard base game
    * `/game setup base_game_mode:True`
* Prophecy of Kings, with Codices I, II, III (POK) 
    * (Bot default)
* Discordant Stars  
Fan expansion that includes 34 new play-tested factions
    * `/game setup discordant_stars_mode:True`
* Absol's Mode  
Includes new components and edits to the game created by absol
    * `/game setup absol_mode:True`
* Franken  
Want to play a game where you make up your very own faction as you go? Franken mod might be for you. During a Franken Draft you choose "draftable" components of TI4 factions to piece together your very own threat to the galaxy. Find out more in the lets-talk-about-franken thread on the main hub.
* Fog of War  
A very unique experience that is well-suited to Async. This game requires a Game Master (GM) and is played with limited vision of the map and limited communication between players. These games are hosted on their own channel in Discord Async TI4, [Fog of War Chapter](https://discord.gg/vq4ze37vDv)
