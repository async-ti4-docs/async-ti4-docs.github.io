There are 2 steps: Scoring and Cleaning up.

## Scoring

You can push the button with the Public Objective (PO) you want to score. You can score your Secret Objective(SO) by using the buttons in your Cards Info thread. Otherwise, please press “No PO Scored”/”No SO Scored” so that the phase can proceed. Players that responded will have their faction symbol displayed under the buttons.

## Cleaning up

1. The bot will prompt the reveal of new PO and automatically clean up. 
2. Players draw Action Cards (ACs) (the bot will take into account Neural Motivator, Scheming, and Crafty for draw and discards) 
3. Take new Command Counters (CC) (the bot will not interfere in this but it will remind players about Versatile, Hyper Metabolism, and Cybernetics Enhancement Omega). 
4. The final step is to indicate “Ready for Strategy/Agenda Phase”, which will trigger one of the 2 phases when all players have responded. Players that responded will have their faction symbol displayed under the buttons.
