A lot of information is crammed into the map, and learning how various info is displayed will help you quickly grasp the current status of the board and make decisions easier. 

You can find the base website for the map UI on [https://asyncti4.com/ <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i>](https://asyncti4.com/)

In the `pbdX-bot-map-updates` thread, you can press the “Show game” button or type in the command `/show_game` to show the most current map (as some commands and updates will not generate a map on their own, even though the data has been updated).

Or you can click on the Website View button to go to the website https://ti4.westaddisonheavyindustries.com/game/pbdX (replacing X with the game number). This website will usually only update when a new map is drawn, so it’s still better to click “Show game” first. 

The result will be something like below:

>Tip: If you cannot see the map clearly when you open it, you can click on it, and in a corner, you can find an option to “Open in Browser” to open it in your browser for a higher quality image (which corner may differ from device to device). Or you can use the Website View button to go to the website holding the map.
