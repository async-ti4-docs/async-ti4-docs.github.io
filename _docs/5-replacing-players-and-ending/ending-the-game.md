All good times must come to an end, and when a player has achieved supremacy over their defeated opponents, it’s time to end the game and close the channels.

When a player has reached the VP limit set at the beginning of the game, the game will prompt you to end the game with a button, which will do all the hard work for you, including closing the game in the bot, archiving the channels, and creating a post where you can give a summary of your victory. Though if everyone has not scored for their final point total (like if you only win in the Status Phase with Imperial), you should wait for them to complete before pressing the button.

Alternatively, you can also use `/game end confirm:YES` to end the game. It functions the same as the button.

Sometimes, people would like to continue using those channels (for some Campaign games, or a rematch). In those cases, please don’t use the button or the /game end command (as it would close the channels), but please use the command `/special rematch`.
