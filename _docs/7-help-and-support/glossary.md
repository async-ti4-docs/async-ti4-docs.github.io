## Terminology 

Lots of users on the discord use many abbreviations for common game terms, and the bot uses some of these as well. Here is a list of some of the most commonly used ones:

* PBD - play by discord
* SC - strategy card
* AC - action card
* TG - trade good
* SO/PO - secret/public objective
* VP - victory point
* PN - promissory note
* CF -Ceasefire
* TA -Trade Agreement
* CC - command counter/token
* Sabo - Sabotage
* Diplo - the diplomacy strategy card
* Tech - technology 
* Wash - a net 0 trade, where commodities of one or both parties are converted to trade goods
* X-1 - the "standard" trade deal. The active player refreshes your commodities and washes them in exchange for 1 trade good (or a commodity which turns into a trade good). Same goes for x-2 - a refresh and wash for 2 trade goods, or x for a free refresh/wash. 
* Guac - a term born out of the SCPT (Space Cats Peace Turtles, a popular TI4 podcast) community that refers to victory points that are ‘extra’ (just like you get guacamole on the side, in addition to your meal) - that is, they are not gained by scoring public and secret objectives (unless you have the Obsidian, which gives you an ‘extra’ secret objective). Guac points include custodians, imperial strategy card points, imperial rider, shard of the throne, agenda generated points (mutiny, seed of an empire etc.) and any other points not generated from POs or SOs. 

## Unit abbreviations 
The following are abbreviations the bot recognizes for the different unit types in the game:
* Infantry - inf, gf
* Mech - mech
* Fighter - ff
* Destroyer - dd
* Cruiser - cr
* Carrier - cv
* Dreadnought - dn, dread
* Flagship - fs, flaggy
* War Sun - ws
* Space Dock - sd, dock
* Planetary defense system - pds, pd

>Tip: the bot does not like spaces ever, so the bot cannot understand ‘space dock’ but would work if you write ‘spacedock’. Likewise, the bot uses only lowercase letters but for the most part knows to convert any input into lower case letters.
