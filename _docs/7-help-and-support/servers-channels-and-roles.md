## Servers

The Async TI4 community has 3 main servers:
* Asynchronous TI4 (Hub): The main server, where players come to create games, ask questions, and also where the developers announce changes to the bot together with various other things.
* Async TI4 (Stroter’s Paradise): The overflow server. Because the Async TI4 games create a huge number of threads and channels, often the main server will be full to capacity, and new games will be directed to this server. There are also some channels here where you can ask questions, but announcements will only happen on the main server. Most people will join both servers anyway.
* Async TI4, Fog Of War Chapter: The server dedicated to FOW games. This is due to the large amount of channels and roles that a FOW game requires. FOW games are better formed and created in the FOW server.

## Helpful channels in the main server (Asynchronous TI4)

Within the Asynchronous TI4 (Hub) server, these are the channels you you should keep an eye out for (outside of the channels for your games):

### “Welcome! Get into a game!”
