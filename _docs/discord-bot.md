Platform note: the bot is designed so that every player can trigger their own move. As a general rule, everything can be done on mobile.  There are many users who only play async this way. Others find that Discord is much easier to use with a desktop. Occasionally, updates on iOS or Android may affect functionality; for instance, we’ve had issues with map resolution after some Android updates. If something doesn’t work, try to restart discord on your phone or ask for troubleshooting help in #general-chat or #bot-questions-and-feedback channel.

### This interaction failed

Sometimes, the bot will seem unresponsive, which usually means that it’s under heavy load, and Discord just hasn't received the response yet. It would show the below info. In those cases, please wait for about 10-15 seconds to see if the bot would respond or not before trying to push the button or run the command again.

### Playing Bot is Restarting

Also sometimes, the bot is rebooted to add in new features, and would be unresponsive with the below info. Please wait for about 2-3 minutes to try again.
