## Is there a list of all the components?

You can see a full list of components here: [**https://www.dfwgamingvillage.com/ti.html**](https://www.dfwgamingvillage.com/ti.html)


You can also use the `/search` bot command to search across different sources, such as: `/search techs source:base`

## Is there a way to change the Speaker order?

From [Game setup](/docs/game-setup/#standard-game-commands):

`/game set_order:` Set the speaker order of the game. The first player listed should be the R1 Speaker and will occupy the 12:00 (uppermost) position on the map. (This can be done by clicking the button shown in the channel at the noted time, but itâ€™s still useful to know the command behind it).
