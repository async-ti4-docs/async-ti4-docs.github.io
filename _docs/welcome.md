## Start

This guide will walk you through how to play a game of Twilight Imperium 4th Edition (â„¢), asynchronously, on a discord server. The server has a bot that helps the games run smoothly without the need for a third party moderator.  The bot (TI Management Bot) handles secret information, including card draws, and keeps track of the board state. Since the bot is still a work in progress, things change frequently, and our developers are continually working to improve user experience. As of October 2024, the bot implements all game mechanics from Prophecy of Kings (POK) and Codex I-III. It even incorporates some optional elements from the most popular homebrew variants on our server.  

These docs attempt to be thorough and simple so that it would be readable to new players that are not used to playing asynchronously.

We assume that you know the rules of the game and have a general familiarity with factions and cards. Occasionally, a common term or abbreviation might slip in so check out the glossary at the end if something isn't clear. 

For any questions or if you need any help, please visit the #bot-questions-and-feedback channel on the server or tag a `@Bothelper`.
